# About project
This project was created to show pairwise distances between protein structures. The information about protein is taken from PDB(Protein Data Bank). 
My coursework is being developed. The final result will be shown later.

# Information
As I've mentioned this project takes the information about the structure from `PDB`.

There are some links that were used in this coursework : 
* The information about `Identifiers in PDB` : https://www.rcsb.org/docs/general-help/identifiers-in-pdb#small-molecule-instance-id
* `The ATOM records` present the atomic coordinates for standard amino acids and nucleotides : https://files.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/doc/format_descriptions/Format_v33_Letter.pdf (page 187)
* `A typical PDB file describing a protein` from Wiki : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank_(file_format)

You can see an example of `ATOM Record Format` (Page 189)
